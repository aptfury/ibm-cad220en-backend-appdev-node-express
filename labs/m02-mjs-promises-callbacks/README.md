### TASK 1

Create a script which has two methods that return promises - One of the promises should get reolved after 6 seconds timeout and the other one after 3 seconds timeout. Call the promise in such a way that the second promise is invoked after the first promise is resolved.

### TASK 2

Change the code to call the promises sequentially and see how the output changes.
